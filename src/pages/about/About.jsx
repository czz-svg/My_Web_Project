        Hello! I am the creator of this website. I graduated from the University
        of Science, Ho Chi Minh City, where I built a strong foundation in
        technology and problem solving. This project reflects my passion for
        learning, creating, and sharing useful tools that can make life easier
        and more enjoyable.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am always eager to explore new ideas, improve my skills, and continue
        building projects that combine creativity with practicality. Thank you
        for visiting my website!
